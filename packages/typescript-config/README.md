This package contains all the TypeScript configuration files used throughout the monorepo.

## ðŸš€ Usage

To use one of the configurations in your package, reference it in your `tsconfig.json`:

  "extends": "@repo/typescript-config/base.json"
}
```

## ðŸ“š Available Configurations

- ðŸ”§ `base.json`: Base configuration for TypeScript projects

## ðŸ¤” Why Centralized Configuration?
