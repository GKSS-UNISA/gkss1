### 4. Create a New Branch 🌿

Always create a new branch for your work:

1. In your terminal, make sure you're in the project folder

3. Type: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name` to upload to GitHub in the new branch named `feature/your-feature-name`

### 7. Merge to Your Fork's Main Branch 🔄

1. Go to your fork on GitHub
2. Create a Pull Request to merge your feature branch into your fork's main branch
3. Wait for any automated tests to complete

### 8. Create a Pull Request to the Main Project 🎉
