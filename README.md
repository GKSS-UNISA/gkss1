### Why React + Vite?
- React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Vite is a modern build tool that provides fast development and optimized production builds. Together, they offer a powerful combination for building web applications.
- Vite (French for "fast", pronounced /veet/) is a modern, ultra-fast build tool and development server designed specifically for web projects.
