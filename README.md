# GKSS1 Monorepo üöÄ

## What is a Monorepo? üìö

A monorepo (monolithic repository) is a version control repository that contains multiple projects or applications within a single repository. This approach offers several benefits:

- Shared code and dependencies
- Consistent tooling and configurations
- Easier collaboration across projects
- Simplified dependency management
- Unified version control

## Repository Structure üìÅ

```

‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ react-site/        # React-based website
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packages/              # Shared packages and utilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json           # Root package.json for workspace management
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ turbo.json             # Turborepo configuration
```
